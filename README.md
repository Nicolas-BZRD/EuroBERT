# EuroBERT: Scaling Multilingual Encoders for European Languages - Training Library

Hello and thank you for your interest in the EuroBERT training library!

I am currently on a well-deserved vacation, but Iâ€™m excited to share that the code base will be released between **March 10 and 14**. This training library was used to train **EuroBERT** and is agnostic to GPU manufacturer (works with both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs).

### For more information, please see:

Otherwise, feel free to send me an email or a Twitter private message if you have any questions.

Thank you for your understanding.
